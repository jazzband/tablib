Introduction
============

This part of the documentation covers all the interfaces of Tablib.
Tablib is a format-agnostic tabular dataset library, written in Python.
It allows you to Pythonically import, export, and manipulate tabular data sets.
Advanced features include segregation, dynamic columns, tags/filtering, and
seamless format import/export.


Philosophy
----------

Tablib was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.

#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Tablib should keep these important rules in mind.
