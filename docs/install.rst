Distribute & Pip
----------------

Of course, the recommended way to install Tablib is with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install tablib

You can also choose to install more dependencies to have more import/export
formats available:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install "tablib[xlsx]"

Or all possible formats:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install "tablib[all]"

which is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install "tablib[html, pandas, ods, xls, xlsx, yaml]"

You can also install Tablib from source.
The latest release (|version|) is available from GitHub.
