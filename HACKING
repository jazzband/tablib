Where possible, please follow PEP8 with regard to coding style. Sometimes the line
length restriction is too hard to follow, so don't bend over backwards there.

Triple-quotes should always be """, single quotes are ' unless using "
would result in less escaping within the string.

All modules, functions, and methods should be well documented reStructuredText for
Sphinx AutoDoc.

All functionality should be available in pure Python. Optional C (via Cython)
implementations may be written for performance reasons, but should never
replace the Python implementation.

Lastly, don't take yourself too seriously :)
